# Akari
Siri knock-off.
Usable on chrome-based browsers at: https://76836.github.io/Akari

Next Update:
Debugging code, adding nicer css, and making a Progressive Web App to install. (I hope)

Version 1.2 update:
Akari can now open any pronouncable app that has a .com domain name, say something like "open Discord" to try it.
You can also search youtube by saying something like "search YouTube for Smarter Every Day" or "play Never Gonna Give You Up".

Version 1.1 update:
The Go Akari button now turns green when Akari is listening (or trying to).
Fixed problem where Chrome would block the "pop-up".

Version 1.0 upload:
I made a thing.
