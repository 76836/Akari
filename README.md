# Akari
Akari Voice Assistant v1.7.
Usable on chrome-based browsers at: https://76836.github.io/Akari
Safari probably won't work. And Firefox doesn't work yet either. YET.

Next update: <br>
Coming soon...

Version 1.7: <br>
Now you can type commands, and Akari can do some basic math. I also redid the CSS.

Version 1.6: <br>
Akari is now fully voice activated, and you can change the speach dictation script in settings, just say "akari, open settings".

Version 1.5: <br>
Added the ability to customize the response script, and the ability to change the speech script.

Version 1.4 update: <br>
Redid the TTS script, added volume control, and added a voice select menu. And, of course, ‚ú®Bug Fixes‚ú®

Version 1.3 Update: 
"Debugged" some code (probably just added more bugs). 
Made some marginally nicer css. 
Made a Progressive Web App to install. 
Split the scripts and css into their own files.

Version 1.2 update:
Akari can now open any pronouncable app that has a .com domain name, say something like "open Discord" to try it.
You can also search youtube by saying something like "search YouTube for Smarter Every Day" or "play Never Gonna Give You Up".

Version 1.1 update:
The Go Akari button now turns green when Akari is listening (or trying to).
Fixed problem where Chrome would block the "pop-up".

Version 1.0 upload:
I made a thing.
